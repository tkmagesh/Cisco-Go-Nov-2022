Paradox Of Choice (Barry Schwartz)

Why Go?
    * Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (No public, private, protected etc)
        - No classes (Only structs)
        - No inheritance (Only composition)
        - No exceptions / try catch finally (Only errors that are values)
        - No reference type (everything is a value by default)
        - No pointer arithmatic
        - No implicit type conversion
        - No compilation to intermediate language 
        - No VM (JVM / CLR)
    * Lightweight
        - Compiled to Machine Code
        - Offers tools for cross compilation
        - Performance is equivalent to C++
    * Support for concurrency
        - OS Threads are not directly used to achieve concurrency (2 MB in Linux)
        - Lightweight thread like infrastructure called "Goroutines" (4 KB)
        - Builtin Scheduler to execute the Goroutines
        - Languages features are built for concurrency
        - go keyword, channel datatype, channel operator ( <- ), range, select case
        - APIs for concurrency (sync package, sync/atomic package)
